# Sentiment Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project implements Sentiment Analysis using Python in Google Colab. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. It is widely used in fields such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and opinion mining.

## Features
- **Preprocessing of text data**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Sentiment classification**: Uses machine learning or deep learning models to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into sentiment distribution.
- **Dataset Handling**: Reads and processes textual datasets for analysis.

## Implementation Details
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`: Data handling and manipulation
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
  - `sklearn`: Machine learning algorithms
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `tensorflow/keras` (if deep learning is used)

## Usage
1. Open the project in Google Colab using the following link:
   [Sentiment Analysis Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PANGAHARISH/HARISH-PANGA/blob/main/Sentimental_Analysis_Using_Python_.ipynb)
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
3. Upload your dataset if required.
4. Observe sentiment classification results and visualizations.

## How to Run
1. **Load the dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in CSV or text format.
2. **Preprocess the data**: Cleaning and preparing the text.
3. **Train the model**: Apply machine learning or deep learning techniques.
4. **Test and evaluate**: Check the accuracy and performance of the model.
5. **Visualize results**: Display sentiment distribution using graphs.

## Applications
- Analyzing customer feedback
- Social media sentiment monitoring
- Product review analysis
- Political sentiment prediction
